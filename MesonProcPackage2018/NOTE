I need to download all the plots from ATLAS webpage, in order to write the proccedings


https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/BPHY-2013-02/fig_01.png

when copy and paste from the somewhere else directly, sometimes the latex will not compile with
the error about: Package inputenc Error: Unicode char \u8:âˆ’ not set up for use with LaTeX.
the problem is from some special characters. I could pin them down manually.
maybe I could try the set paste command



the position of the plot is not correct
