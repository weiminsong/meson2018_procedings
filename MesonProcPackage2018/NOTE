I need to download all the plots from ATLAS webpage, in order to write the proccedings

when copy and paste from the somewhere else directly, sometimes the latex will not compile with
the error about: Package inputenc Error: Unicode char \u8:− not set up for use with LaTeX.
the problem is from some special characters. I could pin them down manually.
maybe I could try the set paste command
