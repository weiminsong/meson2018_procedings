\abstract{%Do not break line here!
Heavy quark spectroscopy and exotic states are studied with the ATLAS detector, mainly
thorough final states containing muon pairs from $J/\psi$ decays from both proton-proton,
proton-lead and lead-lead collisions. This proceedings will summarise recent results from ATLAS,
including production of quarkonium and heavy flavour, searches for exotic states and
measurements of decay properties in open beauty production.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Hardons have been used to test the particle physics Standard Model (SM) for a long time.
%In the current days, they are still crutial for particle physics, for examle by measuring the decay rate
%of $B_s \to \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$, the SM could be checked in a very high precision.
The heavy flavour hadrons are massly produced in the proton proton collisions at Large Hadron Collider.
With ATLAS detector, the production and decay of the heavy flavour hadrons could be studied. 
When comparing with the other detectors which are optimised for hadron physics study, such as Belle (II), BESIII, and
LHCb, the advantage of ATLAS is that the number of recorded hardons is larger, while the disadvantage is the particle identification 
system is not designed for the seperation between different hadrons. 
Normally, the $J/\psi \to \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ is required in the final state, in order to reduce the background, which is much more
higher in the hadron collider when comparing with electron-positron collider.\\ 

In this proceddings, four recent publications from ATLAS are discussed, they are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Search for a Structure in the $B^0_s \pi^\pm$ Invariant Mass Spectrum with the ATLAS Experiment~\cite{x5568}
  \item Measurement of $b$-hadron pair production with the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV~\cite{bpair}
  \item Measurement of quarkonium production in proton–lead and proton–proton collisions at $5.02~\mathrm {TeV}$ with the ATLAS detector~\cite{quark_pro}
  \item Angular analysis of $B^0_d \rightarrow K^{*}\mu^+\mu^-$ decays in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}= 8$ TeV with the ATLAS detector~\cite{kmumu}
\end{itemize}

\section{Is X(5568) observed in the ATLAS dataset?}

In 2016, with 10.4~$fb^(-1)$ proton anti-proton collision data at center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV, the D0 collaboration made a claim about
the discovery of X(5568) in the $B^0_s \pi^\pm$ final states.
